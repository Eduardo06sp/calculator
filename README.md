# Calculator

A simple program that imitates a calculator. The user inputs an expression to be evaluated. If a user chains expressions, the calculator automatically evaluates two expressions at a time. Decimals, backspace and keyboards are supported.

Some useful knowledge I acquired includes:
* Using **CSS Grid** to create clean layouts
* Using **relative em units** for font sizes to improve compatibility with browser settings / **accessibility**
* Continue utilizing a **plan-first** aproach to organize logic and approach difficult problems
* Use **for...of** loops to drastically simplify looping through iterable objects
* Set and use a **keyboard event listener**
* Use **switch** statements
* Use different methods for **integers** versus **floating-point** numbers
* Maintain **mobile-friendly** site using media query breakpoints
* Improve **accessibility** with keyboard support
